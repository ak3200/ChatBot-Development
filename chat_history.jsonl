The available parameters are 0 for ABP (Activation by Personalization) and 1 for OTAA (Over-the-Air Activation). For example, AT+NJM=0 sets the network join mode to ABP, and AT+NJM=1 sets it to OTAA. If the command is used to query the current network join mode, the response would be AT+NJM: followed by the current mode, either 0 for ABP or 1 for OTAA. It can be inferred from the pattern of other commands that AT+NJM=? would provide information on the available parameters for the AT+NJM command, which are 0 for ABP and 1 for OTAA.", "clarification": false, "original_question": null, "timestamp": 1750076751.0327024}
